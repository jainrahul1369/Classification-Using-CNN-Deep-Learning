We will perform a handwritten digit Recognition task using convolutional Neural Network.
In deep learning, CNN is a part of deep neural networks which is commonly used for recognizing
visual images. In our code, We have used multiple layers, the first being the Convolutional layer with
kernel size 5*5 and feature map initially set as 6 followed by max pooling layer with size 2*2.
This is followed by another pair of convolutional layer and max pooling layer. Below are the different
results for the sample set provided based on kernel sizes and feature maps.
